# PenguinOS
- Personal fork of PenguinOS which is based on AOSPA (basically forkÂ²)
- Security last seen in December 2024 (maybe)
- QPR1 coz CLO doesn't upstream and QPR3 from aosp has way too many conflicts
- No gay customisation like EbolaX or infinity cringe 
- Community? No there's no community
  Aage se right waha se fuck off
- ROM builds and boots but we force push often 

**EOL Project Moved To [@PA-XE](https://github.com/pa-xe)**  ([mail](mailto:flynryder427@gmail.com) for access)
